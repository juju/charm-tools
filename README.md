home page for more information.

## Quick Start

### Get Juju

First, you'll need Juju:

    sudo snap install juju --classic

### Get Charm Tools

Most people will want to install charm-tools from the snap store.

    sudo snap install charm

Alternatively you can download the project and run the tip of the code.

    git clone http://github.com/juju/charm-tools
    cd charm-tools


# Tools

In order to use any of these tools you need to have Juju setup and
working in your path

## create

To generate a new charm from a Debian package available on your system

    juju charm create foo

This should add a directory to charms with the name foo, and some of the
metadata.yml and hooks filled in. It will create these in $CHARM_HOME
or under the current working directory.

## proof

To perform basic static analysis on a charm, run

    juju charm proof foo

It will analyze the charm for any obvious mistakes.

## getall

Retrieves all of the charms in the charm distribution via bzr.

## subscribers

This is used to check the quality of maintainer<->bug subscriptions in
launchpad since we do not have this relationship automatically setup.

As a maintainer, if you would like to ensure that you are subscribed to
all of your charms you can run this command:

    juju charm subscribers --fix-unsubscribed --maintainer you@youremail.com --repository path/to/your/charms
