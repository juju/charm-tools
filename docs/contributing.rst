============

The `charm`_ command is created from the combination of two repositorires:

* `charm-tools`_ handles local operations, such as building and linting charms
* `charmstore-client`_ handles interactions with the charm store, such as
  pushing or pulling charms, or managing access controls

Bugs should be filed against the appropriate repository for the most efficient
handling.
